# 👋 Hi, I’m Atharva Gurav

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **data systems, backend engineering, and production AI/ML systems**. I recently completed my **MS in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington**, where I combined solid CS fundamentals with hands-on experience building scalable, real-world systems.

I enjoy working close to the system boundary — thinking about **performance, reliability, evaluation, and tradeoffs** — and shipping solutions that hold up in production.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

* **Data & Platform Engineering**
  Designing and deploying Spark / Databricks pipelines, ingestion workflows, caching layers, and backend services with clear throughput, cost, and fault-tolerance goals.

* **Production AI & ML Systems**
  Building NLP and ML systems end to end — from training and evaluation to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.

* **Retrieval & Search Systems**
  Developing RAG pipelines, vector indexing, semantic search, and ranking systems over large document corpora.

* **Backend & API Development**
  Shipping FastAPI / Flask services with batching, caching, observability, and clean interfaces for downstream users.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### **QueryGenie — RAG System for Research Papers**

* Built a retrieval-augmented QA system over **10K+ documents**
* Improved **Recall@5 from 0.62 → 0.87** using HNSW indexing and cross-encoder reranking
* Deployed with FastAPI, Redis caching, and Docker
* Focused on latency, memory efficiency, and cost optimization

### **AgentLoop — Autonomous AI Agent Framework**

* Designed a tool-using agent with a structured **plan → act → observe → reflect** loop
* Achieved **19/20 task success** with validation, retries, and timeouts
* Published to **PyPI** with logging, tracing, and documented failure modes

### **Neural Machine Translation System**

* Trained Transformer models on **50K sentence pairs**
* Improved BLEU score from **28.4 → 32.7**
* Implemented beam search decoding and deployed an inference API

## 🧑‍💼 Experience Highlights

* **Software Engineer – ML & Data Systems (Contract)**
  Built Spark SQL ingestion pipelines on Databricks, evaluation frameworks, and batch / near-real-time workflows with caching and idempotent writes.

* **Computer Vision Research Assistant**
  Trained and deployed 3D point cloud models (PointNet++, KPConv), built annotation tooling, and shipped inference APIs for large-scale datasets.

* **Software Engineer – ML Systems**
  Developed multimodal NLP systems, fine-tuned large models, and engineered data pipelines processing **100K+ records**.
